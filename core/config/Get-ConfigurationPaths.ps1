function Get-ConfigurationPaths {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets a global object containing configuration paths (e.g. ProjectRootPath), configured in Initialize-ConfigurationPaths.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Returns ConfigurationPaths object created in Initialize-ConfigurationPaths. It has following properties:
    - **ProjectRootPath**         - base directory of the project, relative to the directory where this script resides (it is used as a base directory for other directories)
    - **PackagesPath**            - path to directory with packages
    - **DeployConfigurationPath** - path to directory with configuration files
    - **DeployScriptsPath**       - path to directory with deploy.ps1  
    - **PackagesContainDeployScripts** - $true if $PackagesPath exists and contains DeployScripts / DoIt (used internally)

    .PARAMETER DefaultDeployConfigurationPath
    (internal use) Default DeployConfigurationPath to use if configuration paths have not been initialized yet.

    .PARAMETER NoConfigFiles
    (internal use) If set, configuration files will not be read. You will need to run Environment blocks and Deployment Steps yourself.

    .EXAMPLE
    $configPaths = Get-ConfigurationPaths
    #>

    [CmdletBinding()]
    [OutputType([PSCustomObject])]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [string]
        $DefaultDeployConfigurationPath,

        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [switch]
        $NoConfigFiles
    )

    if (!(Test-Path -LiteralPath variable:global:DoItGlobalConfiguration)) {
        throw 'No global DoItGlobalConfiguration variable.'
    }

    $configPaths = $Global:DoItGlobalConfiguration.ConfigurationPaths
    if (!$configPaths) {
        Initialize-ConfigurationPaths -DeployConfigurationPath $DefaultDeployConfigurationPath -NoConfigFiles:$NoConfigFiles
    }
    return $Global:DoItGlobalConfiguration.ConfigurationPaths
