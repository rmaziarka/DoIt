    PackagesContainDeployScripts - $true if $PackagesPath exists and contains DeployScripts / PSCI
    DeployConfigurationPath - path to directory with configuration files
    DeployScriptsPath       - path to directory with deploy.ps1  

    .PARAMETER DefaultDeployConfigurationPath
    Default DeployConfigurationPath to use if configuration paths have not been initialized yet.

    .EXAMPLE
    $configPaths = Get-ConfigurationPaths
    #>

    [CmdletBinding()]
    [OutputType([PSCustomObject])]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [string]
        $DefaultDeployConfigurationPath
    )

    if (!(Test-Path -LiteralPath variable:global:PSCIGlobalConfiguration)) {
        throw 'No global PSCIGlobalConfiguration variable.'
    }

    $configPaths = $Global:PSCIGlobalConfiguration.ConfigurationPaths
    if (!$configPaths) {
        Initialize-ConfigurationPaths -DeployConfigurationPath $DefaultDeployConfigurationPath
    }
    return $Global:PSCIGlobalConfiguration.ConfigurationPaths
