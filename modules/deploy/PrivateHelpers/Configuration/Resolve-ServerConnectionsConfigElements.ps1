function Resolve-ServerConnectionsConfigElements {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Resolves a hashtable containing ServerConnections for given environment.

    .DESCRIPTION
    It reads global Environments hashtable, e.g.:

    $Environments = @{ 
        Default = @{
            ServerConnections = @{
               Name1 = @{
                    Node = $null
               }
               Name2 = ...
            }
        }
        Dev = @{
            ServerConnections = @{
                Name1 = @{
                    Node = 'node1'
               }
            }
        }
    }

    And creates following structure (when resolved for environment Dev):

    $ServerConnections = @{ 
        Name1 = @{ 
            Nodes = 'node1' 
        }
        Name2 = ...
    }
   
    .PARAMETER AllEnvironments
    Hashtable containing all environment definitions.

    .PARAMETER Environment
    Name of the environment which the ServerRoles should be resolved for.

    .PARAMETER ResolvedTokens
    Resolved tokens.

    .EXAMPLE
    $serverConnections = Resolve-ServerConnectionsConfigElements -AllEnvironments $AllEnvironments -Environment $env -ResolvedTokens $resolvedTokens
