function New-DeploymentPlan {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a deployment plan basing on global variables $Tokens, $ServerRoles and parameters passed to this function.

    .DESCRIPTION
    It iterates through resolved ServerRoles (created for given environment with Resolve-ServerRoles) and Steps defined in each ServerRole,
    and creates a deployment plan entry for each of such step.
    If the step is a DSC configuration (as opposed to function), it will be run and MOF files will be created for each node.
    The deployment plan has a form of array of hashtables @( $hashTableForNode1, $hashTableForNode2, ...) where each hashTable has the structure you can
    see in New-DeploymentPlanEntry:

    ConnectionParams = <ConnectionParameters object containing connection information for the destination server (where the packages will be deployed)>
    RunOnConnectionParams = <ConnectionParameters object containing connection information for the server where the deployment steps will run>
    IsLocalRun = <$True if destination server is the same as the server where the deployment steps will run>
    Environment = <Environment name>
    ServerRole = <ServerRole name>
    StepName = <Name of DSC configuration or custom function that will be run on the destination server>
    StepType = <'Configuration' for DSC configuration or 'Function' for custom function>
    ConfigurationMofDir = <Directory where the generated .mof file resides - only used if StepType = 'Configuration'>
    Tokens = <Hashtable containing resolved tokens - they can be varying between Environment/Nodes combinations>
    TokensOverride = <Hashtable containing tokens overriden by user - passed directly to deploy.ps1>
    PackageDirectory = <Path to the directory where the files required for the deployment will be copied - only used if deployment steps will not run locally>
    RequiredPackages = <List of packages required for the deployment as specified by the user in the configuration files>
    RebootHandlingMode = <Determines how to handle reboot requests - only used if StepType = 'Configuration'>

    .PARAMETER AllEnvironments
    Hashtable containing all environment definitions.

    .PARAMETER Environment
    Name of the environment where the packages will be deployed.

    .PARAMETER ServerRolesFilter
    List of ServerRole names that should be included in the deployment plan.

    .PARAMETER StepsFilter
    List of Steps to deploy - can be used if you don't want to deploy all steps defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, steps will be deployed according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .PARAMETER NodesFilter
    List of Nodes where steps have to be deployed - can be used if you don't want to deploy to all nodes defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, steps will be deployed to all nodes according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .PARAMETER TokensOverride
    A list of tokens to override. Token defined in the configuration files will be overrided with values specified in this array 
    (tokens will be matched by name, ignoring categories).

    .PARAMETER DscOutputPath
    Path where the .MOF files will be generated.

    .PARAMETER DeployType
    Deployment type:
    All       - deploy everything according to configuration files (= Provision + Deploy)
    DSC       - deploy only DSC configurations
    Functions - deploy only Powershell functions
    Adhoc     - override steps and nodes with $StepsFilter and $NodesFilter (they don't have to be defined in ServerRoles - useful for adhoc deployments)
