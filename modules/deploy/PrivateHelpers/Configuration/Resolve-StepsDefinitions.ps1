    .SYNOPSIS
    Resolves StepsDefinitions inside Environment.
            
    .PARAMETER AllEnvironments
    Hashtable containing all environment definitions.

    .PARAMETER Environment
    Name of the environment which the ServerRoles should be resolved for.

    .PARAMETER StepsFilter
    List of Steps to deploy - can be used if you don't want to deploy all steps defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, steps will be deployed according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .EXAMPLE
    $StepsDefinitions = Resolve-StepsDefinitions -AllEnvironments $AllEnvironments -Environment $Environment -StepsFilter $StepsFilter
