function Resolve-ServerConnections {
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Resolves ServerConnections.

    .PARAMETER Environment
    Name of the environment where the packages will be deployed.

    .PARAMETER AllServerConnections
    Hashtable containing all defined ServerConnections.

    .PARAMETER SelectedServerConnections
    List of names of ServerConnections to resolve.

    .PARAMETER NodesFilter
    List of Nodes where steps have to be deployed - can be used if you don't want to deploy to all nodes defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, steps will be deployed to all nodes according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .PARAMETER DeployType
    Deployment type:
    All       - deploy everything according to configuration files (= Provision + Deploy)
    DSC       - deploy only DSC configurations
    Functions - deploy only Powershell functions
    Adhoc     - override steps and nodes with $StepsFilter and $NodesFilter (they don't have to be defined in ServerRoles - useful for adhoc deployments)

    .PARAMETER ServerRole
    ServerRole containing the steps to resolve.

    .PARAMETER ResolvedTokens
    Resolved tokens.

    .EXAMPLE
    Resolve-ServerConnections -Environment $Environment -AllServerConnections $ServerConnections -SelectedServerConnections $serverRole.ServerConnections `
                              -NodesFilter $NodesFilter -DeployType $DeployType -ServerRoleName $serverRole.Name
