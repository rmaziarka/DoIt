function Write-DscErrorsFromEventLog {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Gets log entries from 'Microsoft-Windows-DSC/Operational' event log, where DSC errors are logged.

    .PARAMETER ComputerName
    Computer name whose event log should be queried. Note PSRemoting does not need to be enabled there, but
    firewall must allow to query Event Log (rules 'Remote Event Log Management *')

    .PARAMETER Credential
    Credentials to use to connect to $ComputerName's Event Log.

    .PARAMETER StartTime
    Only events that occurred after this time will be returned.

    .PARAMETER EndTime
    Only events that occurred before this time will be returned.

    .PARAMETER WaitTimeoutInSeconds
    Time to wait for event log entries to appear.

    .EXAMPLE
    Write-DscErrorsFromEventLog -StartTime '2014-10-25 14:48'
