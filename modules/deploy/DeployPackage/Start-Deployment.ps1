function Start-Deployment {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Starts the actual deployment basing on the configuration files. This is an entry point for the project-specific deployment script.

    .DESCRIPTION
    It does the following steps:

    1. Loads configuration files containing environments and tokens to global variable $Environments.
    2. Creates a deployment plan basing on $Environments and parameters passed to this function. 
       Each node gets its own resolved tokens. The deployment plan can be accessed by querying $Global:DeploymentPlan variable.
    3. Runs the deployment plan by deploying configurations node by node.

    .PARAMETER Environment
    Name of the environment where the packages will be deployed.

    .PARAMETER ServerRolesFilter
    List of ServerRoles to deploy - can be used if you don't want to deploy all server roles defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, all server roles will be deployed.

    .PARAMETER StepsFilter
    List of Steps to deploy - can be used if you don't want to deploy all steps defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, steps will be deployed according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .PARAMETER NodesFilter
    List of Nodes where steps have to be deployed - can be used if you don't want to deploy to all nodes defined in the configuration files.
    If not set, steps will be deployed to all nodes according to the ServerRoles defined in the configuration files.

    .PARAMETER ValidateOnly
    If set, configuration files will be loaded and deployment plan created, but no actual deployment will run.
    You can use it to validate global hashtables $Tokens, $ServerRoles and $DeploymentPlan.

    .PARAMETER AutoInstallDscResources
    If true (default), custom DSC resources included in PSCI will be automatically copied to localhost (required for parsing DSC configurations)
    and to the destination servers (required for running DSC configurations).  

    .PARAMETER TokensOverride
    A list of tokens to override. Token defined in the configuration files will be overrided with values specified in this array 
    (tokens will be matched by name, ignoring categories).

    .PARAMETER DeployType
    Deployment type:
    - **All**       - deploy everything according to configuration files (= Provision + Deploy)
    - **Provision** - deploy only provisioning steps (-StepsProvision)
    - **Deploy**    - deploy only deploy steps (-StepsDeploy / -Steps) 
    - **Adhoc**     - override steps and nodes with $StepsFilter and $NodesFilter (they don't have to be defined in ServerRoles - useful for adhoc deployments)

    .PARAMETER DeployConfigurationPath
    Path to the directory where configuration files reside, relative to current directory. 
    Can be used for ad-hoc deployments (without Initialize-ConfigurationPaths invocation).

    .PARAMETER NoConfigFiles
    If specified, configuration files will not be read. You will need to run Environment blocks and Deployment Steps yourself.
