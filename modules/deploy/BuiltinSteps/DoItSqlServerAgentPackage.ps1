function DoItSqlServerAgentPackage {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Deploys one or more SQL Server Agent packages (containing SQL Server Agent job definitions).

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function can be invoked both locally (preferred - but SQL Server port will need to be open) and remotely (-RunRemotely - without restrictions).
    It uses following tokens:
    - **SqlServerAgentPackages** - hashtable (or array of hashtables) with following keys:
      - **PackageName** - (required) name of SQL Server Agent package to deploy (the same as in [[Build-SqlServerAgentPackage]])
      - **ConnectionString** - (required) connection string that will be used to connect to the destination database
      - **ReplaceOwnerLoginName** - if specified, all occurrences of @owner_login_name='...' will be replaced by specified string. This way you don't have to modify the script that is created by SSMS command if you want to deploy it in different domain
      - **PreserveJobHistry** - if $True, job history will be preserved in a backup table before deleting the job and restored afterwards
      - **PackagePath** - path to the package containing dacpac file(s) (If not provided, $PackagePath = $PackagesPath\$PackageName, where $PackagesPath is taken from global variable)
      - **SqlCmdVariables** - hashtable containing custom sqlcmd variables
      - **QueryTimeoutInSeconds** - can be used to override default timeout (1 hour)
      - **Mode** - determines how the sqls are run - by sqlcmd.exe or .NET SqlCommand (default).
      - **Credential** - credentials to impersonate (only when mode = sqlcmd and using Windows Authentication)
      
    See also [[Build-SqlServerAgentPackage]] and [[Deploy-SqlServerAgentPackage]].

    .PARAMETER Tokens
    (automatic parameter) Tokens hashtable - see description for details.

    .EXAMPLE
    ```
    Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\..\DoIt\DoIt.psd1" -Force

    Build-SqlServerAgentPackage -PackageName 'SqlServerAgentJobs' -ScriptsPath '$PSScriptRoot\..\test\SqlServerAgentJobs'

    # clear any old Environment definitions - required only for -NoConfigFiles deployments
    $Global:Environments = @{}

    Environment Local { 
        ServerConnection DatabaseServer -Nodes localhost
        ServerRole Database -Steps 'DoItSqlServerAgentPackage' -ServerConnection DatabaseServer

        Tokens DatabaseSqlServerAgent @{
            SqlServerAgentPackages = @{
                PackageName = 'SqlServerAgentJobs'
                ConnectionString = { $Tokens.Database.ConnectionString }
                SqlCmdVariables = @{ MyVariable = 'myvar' }
            }
        }

        Tokens Database @{
            ConnectionString = "Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=DoItTest;Integrated Security=SSPI"
        }
    }

    try { 
        Start-Deployment -Environment Local -NoConfigFiles
    } catch {
        Write-ErrorRecord
    }

    ```
    Builds SQL Server Agent package and deploys it to localhost.
