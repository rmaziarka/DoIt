function DoItSSISIspac {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Deploys one or more SSIS .ispac packages.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function can be invoked locally (if SQL Server is in the same domain and current user has permissions) or remotely (-RunRemotely - without restrictions).
    It uses following tokens:
    - **SSISPackages** - hashtable (or array of hashtables) with following keys:
      - **PackageName** - (required) name of SSIS package to deploy (the same as in [[Build-SSISIspac]])
      - **ConnectionString** - (required) connection string that will be used to connect to the destination database
      - **Catalog** - destination SSIS catalog (default SSISDB) - will be created if doesn't exist
      - **CatalogPassword** - Password for SSIS catalog
      - **Folder** - destination SSIS folder (will be created if doesn't exist)
      - **FolderDescription** - description of SSIS folder (when creating a new Folder). If not specified, 'Project folder' will be used.
      - **EnvironmentsDefinition** - SSIS environments to create, in following format:
```
        @{ 'Local' = @{
                ServerName = '${DatabaseNode}'
                DatabaseName = '${DatabaseName}'
           }
           'Dev' = @{
                ServerName = 'dev.local'
                DatabaseName = 'db.local'
           }
        }
```
      - **PackagesParameters** - SSIS parameters to override in specific packages in following format (only parameters referencing environment variables are currently supported):
```
    @{ 'mypackage.dtsx' = @{
            'mypackage.ServerName' = 'ServerName'
            'mypackage.DatabaseName' = 'DatabaseName'
       }
    }
```
      - **PackagePath** - path to the package containing sql files. If not provided it will be set to $PackagesPath\$PackageName
      
    See also [[Build-SSISIspac]] and [[Deploy-SSISIspac]].

    .PARAMETER Tokens
    (automatic parameter) Tokens hashtable - see description for details.

    .EXAMPLE
    ```
    Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\..\DoIt\DoIt.psd1" -Force

    Build-SSISIspac -PackageName 'MyETL' -ProjectPath "$PSScriptRoot\..\test\SampleETL\SampleETL.sln" -Configuration 'Development' -VisualStudioVersion 2012
    
    # clear any old Environment definitions - required only for -NoConfigFiles deployments
    $Global:Environments = @{}

    Environment Local { 
        ServerConnection DatabaseServer -Nodes localhost
        ServerRole Database -Steps 'DoItSSISIspac' -ServerConnection DatabaseServer

        Tokens Database @{
            SSISPackages = @{
                PackageName = 'MyETL';
                ConnectionString = { $Tokens.Database.ConnectionString }
                Catalog = 'SSISDB'
                CatalogPassword = 'SSISDB2012'
                Folder = 'MyETL'
            }
        }

        Tokens Database @{
            ConnectionString = "Server=localhost;Integrated Security=SSPI"
        }
    }

    try { 
        Start-Deployment -Environment Local -NoConfigFiles
    } catch {
        Write-ErrorRecord
    }

    ```
    Builds SSIS package and deploys it to localhost.
