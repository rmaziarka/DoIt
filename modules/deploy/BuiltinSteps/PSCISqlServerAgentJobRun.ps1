function PSCISqlServerAgentJobRun {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Runs one or more SQL Server Agent jobs.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function can be invoked both locally (preferred - but SQL Server port will need to be open) and remotely (-RunRemotely - without restrictions).
    It uses following tokens:
    - **SqlServerAgentJobsToRun** - hashtable (or array of hashtables) with following keys:
      - **JobName** - (required) name of the job to run
      - **ConnectionString** - (required) connection string that will be used to connect to the destination database
      - **StepName** - the name of the step at which to begin execution of the job (if not specified, job will start at first step)
      - **Synchronous** - if $true (default), job will be run synchronously (will wait until it ends)
      - **TimeoutInSeconds** - if specified and Synchronous is $true, function will fail after TimeoutInSeconds seconds (otherwise it waits indefinitely)
      - **ValidateRunOutcome** - if $true and Synchronous if $true, function will check job outcome and fail if it's not 'succeeded' or timeout occurs
      - **QueryTimeoutInSeconds** - can be used to override default timeout (1 hour)
      
    See also [[Start-SqlServerAgentJob]].

    .PARAMETER Tokens
    (automatic parameter) Tokens hashtable - see description for details.

    .EXAMPLE
    ```
    Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\..\PSCI\PSCI.psd1" -Force

    # clear any old Environment definitions - required only for -NoConfigFiles deployments
    $Global:Environments = @{}

    Environment Local { 
        ServerConnection DatabaseServer -Nodes localhost
        ServerRole Database -Steps 'PSCISqlServerAgentJobRun' -ServerConnection DatabaseServer

        Tokens DatabaseSqlServerAgent @{
            SqlServerAgentJobsToRun = @{
                JobName = 'MyJob'
                ConnectionString = { $Tokens.Database.ConnectionString }
            }
        }

        Tokens Database @{
            ConnectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=PSCITest;Integrated Security=SSPI"
        }
    }

    try { 
        Start-Deployment -Environment Local -NoConfigFiles
    } catch {
        Write-ErrorRecord
    }

    ```
    Runs job 'MyJob' at waits until it ends (fails if job fail).
