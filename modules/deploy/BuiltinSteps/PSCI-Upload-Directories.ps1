function PSCI-Upload-Directories {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Uploads specific directories to remote host using administrative shares or WinRM (if share is not accessible).

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function should be invoked locally (without -RunRemotely). 
    It uses following tokens:
    - **UploadDirectories** - hashtable in form @{ '<source_directory relative to packagesPath>' = '<destination_directory>' }
    - **UploadDirectoriesCheckHashMode** (optional) - type of hash check (optimization) - default 'DontCheckHash'. Available values:
        - DontCheckHash - files are always uploaded to the servers
        - AlwaysCalculateHash - files are uploaded to the servers if their hashes calculated in local path and in remote path are different
        - UseHashFile - files are uploaded to the servers if there doesn't exist a syncHash_<hash> file, where hash is hash calculated in local path. The file is created/replaced automatically.
    For details, see [[Copy-FilesToRemoteServer]].

    .PARAMETER NodeName
    (automatic parameter) Name of node where the directories will be uploaded to.

    .PARAMETER ServerRole
    (automatic parameter) Name of current server role.

    .PARAMETER Tokens
    (automatic parameter) Tokens hashtable - see description for details.

    .PARAMETER ConnectionParams
    (automatic parameter) Connection parameters taken from current ServerConnection (see [[New-ConnectionParameters]]).

    .EXAMPLE
    ```
    Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\..\PSCI\PSCI.psd1" -Force

    Environment Local { 
        ServerConnection WebServer -Nodes localhost
        ServerRole Web -Steps 'PSCI-Upload-Directories' -ServerConnection WebServer

        Tokens Web @{
            UploadDirectories = @{
                'c:\PSCITestSource1' = 'c:\PSCITestDestination1'
                'c:\PSCITestSource2' = 'c:\PSCITestDestination2'
            }
            UploadDirectoriesCheckHashMode = 'UseHashFile'
        }
    }

    Start-Deployment -Environment Local -NoConfigFiles
    ```
    Uploads specified directories to remote server (localhost in this example).
