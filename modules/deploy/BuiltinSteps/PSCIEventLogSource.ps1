function PSCIEventLogSource {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Ensures specific Event Log Sources exist.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function should be invoked remotely (with -RunRemotely). 
    It uses following tokens:
    - **EventLogSources** - hashtable or array of hashtables in form @{ Name = <event log source name> (required); LogName = <log name> (optional) } 

    See also [[New-EventLogSource]].

    .PARAMETER Tokens
    (automatic parameter) Tokens hashtable - see description for details.

    .EXAMPLE
    ```
    Import-Module "$PSScriptRoot\..\PSCI\PSCI.psd1" -Force

    # clear any old Environment definitions - required only for -NoConfigFiles deployments
    $Global:Environments = @{}

    Environment Local { 
        ServerConnection WebServer -Nodes localhost
        ServerRole Web -Steps 'PSCIEventLogSource' -ServerConnection WebServer

        Tokens Web @{
            EventLogSources = @(
                @{ Name = 'MyEventLogSource' },
                @{ Name = 'MyEventLogSource2'; LogName = 'MyLogName' }
            )
        }
    }

    try { 
        Start-Deployment -Environment Local -NoConfigFiles
    } catch {
        Write-ErrorRecord
    }
    ```
    Uploads specified directories to remote server (localhost in this example).

    [CmdletBinding()]
    [OutputType([void])]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [hashtable]
        $Tokens
    )

    $eventLogSources = Get-TokenValue -Name 'EventLogSources'

    if (!$eventLogSources) {
        Write-Log -Warn 'No EventLogSources defined in tokens.'
        return
    }

     foreach ($eventLogSource in $eventLogSources) {
        Write-Log -Info ("Starting PSICEventLogSource, node ${NodeName}: {0}" -f (Convert-HashtableToString -Hashtable $eventLogSource))
        New-EventLogSource -SourceName $eventLogSource.Name -LogName $eventLogSource.LogName
    }
}
