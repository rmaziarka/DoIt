function PSCISSDTDacpac {

    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Deploys one or more SSDT packages.

    .DESCRIPTION
    This function can be invoked both locally (preferred) and remotely (-RunRemotely).
    It uses following tokens:
    - **SsdtPackages** - hashtable (or array of hashtables) with following keys:
      - **PackageName** - (required) name of SSDT package to deploy (the same as in [[Build-SSDTPackage]])
      - **DacPacFilePath** - paths to .dacpac files to be deployed (relative to PackagePath) - if not specified, it is assumed $PackageName.dacpac by convention
      - **UpgradeExisting** - true to allow modification of existing database schema in order to match schema contained in source package; false to block modification of existing database (if the database does not exist this flag has no effect)
      - **ConnectionString** - connection string that will be used to connect to the destination database (note it will override connection string specified in PublishProfile)
      - **TargetDatabase** - name of the target database for deployment (If not specified, it will be taken from ConnectionString / Initial Catalog)
      - **DacDeployOptions** - deploy options to use - can be either Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.DacDeployOptions or a hashtable (see [msdn1](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sqlserver.dac.dacdeployoptions.aspx) and [msdn2](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh550080%28v=vs.103%29.aspx))
      - **SqlCmdVariables** - hashtable containing sqlcmd variables
      - **PublishProfile** - path to publish profile to use (note it is optional and parameters ConnectionString, TargetDatabase and DacDeployOptions will take precedence)
      - **PackagePath** - path to the package containing dacpac file(s) (If not provided, $PackagePath = $PackagesPath\$PackageName, where $PackagesPath is taken from global variable)
      - **SqlServerVersion** - destination SQL Server version (2012 or 2014). It determines DAC dlls that will be loaded. If not specified, the newest version will be used.
      
    See also [[Deploy-SSDTDacpac]].

    .PARAMETER Tokens
    (automatic parameter) Tokens hashtable - see description for details.

    try { 
        Start-Deployment -Environment Local -NoConfigFiles
    } catch {
        Write-ErrorRecord
    }

    ```
    Builds SSDT package and deploys it to localhost.
