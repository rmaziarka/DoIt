function Build-SqlServerAgentPackage {
     <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Builds a package containing SQL Server agent (jobs) files.

    .DESCRIPTION
    It assumes that jobs are scripted to sql files (using CREATE TO from SSMS).
    It copies all *.sql files from $ScriptsPath to $OutputPath (or $PackagesPath\$PackageName if $OutputPath is not provided).

    .PARAMETER PackageName
    Name of the package. It determines OutputPath if it's not provided.

    .PARAMETER ScriptsPath
    Path to the sql scripts. They will be copied to OutputPath.

    .PARAMETER OutputPath
    Output path where the package will be created. If not provided, $OutputPath = $PackagesPath\$PackageName, where $PackagesPath is taken from global variable.

    .PARAMETER Include
    The files to be included in the package.

    .PARAMETER Exclude
    The files to be excluded from the package.

    .EXAMPLE
    Build-SqlServerAgentPackage -PackageName 'YourProject.SqlServerAgent' -ScriptsPath 'Database\DbName\SqlServerAgent'
