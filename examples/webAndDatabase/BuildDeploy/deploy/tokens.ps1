This file contains tokens, i.e. variables that can be different across environments or nodes.
Resolved $Tokens variable is available in steps (DSC and functions).
Tokens are inherited from parent environments, so e.g. all Tokens defined in 'Default' environment (default parent of all environments) are available in 'Local' environment,
and child tokens can override parent tokens.

If token value is a string, you can use placeholders ${TokenName} where TokenName is another token name, or predefined 'Node' (destination node name).
If token value is a scriptblock, you can use variables $Tokens, $Node and $Environment.
